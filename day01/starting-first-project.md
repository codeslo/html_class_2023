# How to Start the Learn to Code Site

Throughout this class, we will create a web page that will teach users about the core technologies of web development.

As we learn more about HTML and CSS, we'll add what we learn to this page.

## Exercise 01

1. Create a folder called learn-to-code
2. Inside that folder, create a file called index.html
3. Use `html5-boilerplate` to create the structure of the webpage
4. Add the title 'Learn to Code'
5. Create an h1 with 'Learn to Code'
6. Create h2s for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (one each)
7. Add paragraphs for each of the h2s
8. Save and view page with `Live Server`
